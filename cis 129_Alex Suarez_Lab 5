# Module 5 lab 5 : Reptillian Structure
# Description: This program allows a grocery store to keep track of the total 
# number of bottles returned over a period of seven days. It calculates the total 
# number of bottles and the total payout, and it allows for multiple weekly entries
# condition controlled WHILE LOOP used  when keep going = y


# Lab 5: Returned bottle count 
#________________________________________________________

# Declare variables
total_bottles = 0  # Stores the accumulated number of bottles
counter = 1        # Controls the loop (used in Step 4 for the count-controlled loop)
today_bottles = 0  # Stores the number of bottles returned on a day
total_payout = 0.0 # Stores payout (total_bottles times $0.10)
keep_going = "y"   # Used to determine if the program should run again
# Constants
NBR_OF_DAYS = 7 # Number of days to collect bottles
PAYOUT_PER_BOTTLE = 0.10 # Payout per bottle

# Main program loop
keep_going = 'y'
while keep_going == 'y':
    # Step 1: Initialize variables at the start of each loop iteration
    total_bottles = 0  # count for the total number of bottles
    total_payout = 0.0  # Will store the calculated total payout
    counter = 1  # Counter for the loop that collects daily bottles
    
    # Step 4: Counter-controlled loop for daily bottle collection
    while counter <= NBR_OF_DAYS:
        print(f"Enter number of bottles returned for day #{counter}: ", end='') # Prompt user for daily bottle return count
        today_bottles = int(input())  # Collect daily bottle return count
        total_bottles += today_bottles  # Accumulate total bottles
        counter += 1  # Increment counter for each day
    
    # Step 5: Calculate total payout
    total_payout = total_bottles * PAYOUT_PER_BOTTLE
    
    # Step 6: Display results
    print(f"The total number of bottles collected is: {total_bottles}") # f is used to format the string
    print(f"The total payout is: ${total_payout:.2f}")  #.2f is used to format the string to 2 decimal places
    
    # Ask if the user wants to process another week's data
    keep_going = input("Do you want to enter another week's worth of data? (Enter y or n): ").lower() # .lower() is used to convert the input to lowercase


# Program end, i like to end things clearly.
print("Program has ended. Goodbye!")
