#________________________________________________________
"""
Description:
This script prompts the user to enter grades which are stored in 'grades.txt'. The user can enter any number
of grades and the input is terminated by a sentinel value. After all grades are entered, the script calculates
the class average and writes the grades to the 'grades.txt' file.

Usage:
- Run the script.
- Enter each grade at the prompt.
- Enter '-1' to finish inputting and calculate the class average.
- The grades and the class average are saved to 'grades.txt'.
